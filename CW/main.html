Above the garage is a one-bedroom annexe, replete with fully fitted high specification kitchen. Ideal as independent accommodation for guests, visitors or relatives, this sumptuous space, warmed by underfloor heating could serve as guest accommodation, a home office or gym.Whinthwaite House, however, is so much more than its imposing stonework; it is a home lovingly redesigned, restored and renovated from the tips of its re-pointed chimney stacks to the marbled tiling of its wet-room ensuite.Dating back to 1874, understated glamour is evident in each room at Whinthwaite House and is lovingly teased out through the use of complementary and sympathetic dÃ©cor; at once paying homage to the home's original features and heralding its arrival into the 21st century.Sense this immediately upon arrival through the formal entrance, painted in timeless tones which allow the patterns of the original Victorian tiles underfoot to take centre stage. Overhead is the first of many, carefully chosen, recreation ceiling roses, which pay testament to the stature of this home. Already, the views to stunning scenery are framed in the windows.Continue through into the grand reception hall; a room with which it is impossible not to fall in love instantly. Above, epitomising the Victorian grandeur of the home, a coffered ceiling is embellished by an ornate ceiling rose.",
